Smart Home Control System

About the Project:

This project models a smart home device management system. The program manages various devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, security cameras) and coordinates their operations. The system implements multiple design patterns.

Applied Design Patterns:

Composite – Organizing devices into a structured hierarchy.

Decorator – Dynamically adding extra functionality to devices.

Abstract Factory – Using factory methods to simplify device creation.

Facade – Providing a unified interface to manage all devices.

Adapter – Integrating third-party or legacy systems with the new system.

Features:

Turn on/off lights, thermostats, and other devices.

Group devices into rooms and manage them collectively.

Add additional functionality like scheduling or logging to devices.

Manage all devices using a single interface.

Integrate third-party systems using an adapter.
